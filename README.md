This is my 1.58 BitNet implementation based on this paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17764

How to use:
1. Git clone the repo
2. Run new-model-architecture-creation.py
3. You'll be prompted for how many parameters you want your model to be
4. The script will create the model and save it in the same repo as where the files are saved

Basically the model is blank and you need to train it. This is where I'm having the biggest issues - I still cant seem to get the training to work properly. 
I need help with this implementation. I've take this as far as I can with my knowledge but for some reason I cant get the training to work properly. 

There is a trainingv2.py script, data_loading_compatibility script, and inference script.
